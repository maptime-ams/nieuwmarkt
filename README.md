# Maptime AMS #7: Mapping the Nieuwmarkt

It's easy to make beautiful interactive web maps with [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) or [D3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery#maps). But if you're designing a map for print, and you want full control over the map design and label placement, there's no way around using GIS software and vector editing software. In the [seventh edition](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-AMS/events/220184224/) of [Maptime Amsterdam](http://maptime-ams.github.io/), we will use [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) (a Free and Open Source Geographic Information System) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) or [Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) to design a map of how the Nieuwmarkt looked just before the construction of [Amsterdam's first subway line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieuwmarkt_Riots).

We will use data and information from the following sources:

- Stories told by Ceel Holtkamp during the walking tour,
- Slides from Actiegroep Nieuwmarkt's archive,
- [Amsterdam OpenStreetMap data](https://mapzen.com/metro-extracts/)

And we will design a map showing the construction of the subway:
